# Python Game
This project was done during grade 11 Computer Engineering course.
After being introducted to python, we were required to create a python project.
I decided to make a small RPG called "The Unnamed Character".
At this time, I only had knowledge of if else statements and loops, so I didn't know how to 
use custom functions, so there is a lot of excess code.
